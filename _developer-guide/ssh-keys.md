{{site.data.tenant.name}} platform **requires from every developer a unique SSH key to authorise any code deployment into the system**. This is a standardised, industry accepted security feature
which is widely used in similar services like GitHub.

## Creating your SSH keys

GitHub has an informative page on SSH Key generation and what you see here is
practically taken from the page
[Generating SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/). Before
moving forward it would be prudent to check for existing SSH Keys on your
computer and if it's necessary to create a new one.

### Check for Existing SSH keys

To see all existing SSH Keys open a terminal and type:
```sh
$ ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
...
drwx------   7 username  staff   238 Aug  3 14:08 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 33 username  staff  1122 Jul 24 09:06 ..
-rw-------   1 username  staff  1766 Jun 25 12:29 github_rsa
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff   403 Jun 25 12:29 github_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff  2005 Aug  3 14:11 known_hosts
```

This shows that this user called username has already GitHub created SSH key
which is possible to use. We recommend creating a new one for a simplicity and
proper record keeping.

### Creating a new SSH key

To create an SSH Key open a terminal and type:
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
...
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again:  [Type a passphrase]
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db username@yourcomputer.local
```
The example above ties your SSH key with your computer.
**Please note:** if you want your SSH key to be connected with your e-mail address then use
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C username@youraddress.com
```
After generating the SSH Key if we check our SSH directory we will get two more entries:
```sh
$ ls -al ~/.ssh
total 40
drwx------   7 username  staff   238 Aug  3 14:08 .
drwxr-xr-x+ 33 username  staff  1122 Jul 24 09:06 ..
-rw-------   1 username  staff  1766 Jun 25 12:29 github_rsa
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff   403 Jun 25 12:29 github_rsa.pub
-rw-------   1 username  staff  3243 Aug  3 14:08 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff   755 Aug  3 14:08 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--   1 username  staff  1595 Jul 28 16:14 known_hosts
```
Use the newly generated `id_rsa.pub` key to work with the platform. For the simplicity type:
```sh
$ less ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```
This command copies the newly created SSH Key into your clipboard, so that you
can paste it into the SSH entry form on the {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform.

## Uploading your SSH keys

To add a newly generated SSH Keys navigate to the **Settings** section from
the personal menu is it shown below:

![Navigate to the Settings section](/assets/img/developer-guide/ssh-keys/ssh-keys-01.png "Navigate to the Settings section")

You are now at your **Profile** page. Click on **SSH Keys** to load your SSH Keys.

![Load your SSH Keys](/assets/img/developer-guide/ssh-keys/ssh-keys-02.png "Load your SSH Keys")

If you don't have any uploaded SSH Keys you will see the following screen:

![No SSH Keys](/assets/img/developer-guide/ssh-keys/ssh-keys-03.png "No SSH Keys")

Click on *+Upload* button to start.

The screenshot below shows a form where you must enter the name of your SSH Key (1)
then paste the actual SSH Key (2) which should still be in your clipboard. The result
would look like this:

![Pasted SSH Key](/assets/img/developer-guide/ssh-keys/ssh-keys-04.png "Pasted SSH Key")

Click on *Save* (3) to finish. The final result would look like this:

![Your SSH Keys](/assets/img/developer-guide/ssh-keys/ssh-keys-05.png "Your SSH Keys")

You can add more SSH keys or delete the current one on this interface.

> **Note** you need this SSH Key to deploy your integration components. If you
> delete it you will not be permitted to deploy any components.
