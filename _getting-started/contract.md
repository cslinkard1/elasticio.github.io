This article covers all the peculiarities of a Contract and Contract Owner entities in terms of our platform. So let's shed some light on how the things are working here.

## What is a Contract

A contract is a structural entity which reflects an agreement Contract between a customer and the platform's provider. It can have an unlimited number of members, workspaces and development teams. The main idea of the Contract is about providing a set of tools for managing users, workspaces and development teams. It also serves as a singular entity for billing purposes providing an opportunity for tracking the resources consumed by all the integration flows.

Every member of the Contract has one unique access level or role within the current Contract: Contract Admin or a Member. The same user on the platform can have different roles in different Contracts.

> Please note the Tenant Admin can create Contract unit and the first Contract Admin. Once the unit is created the Contract Admin can invite other users and set their level of access. (Tenant is a higher structure, which includes all Contracts that belong to the white-label client).

## What is a Contract Owner

Contract Owner is a specific dedicated Admin role with an exclusive rights for user management.
